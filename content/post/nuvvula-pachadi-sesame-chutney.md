Nuvvula pachadi or sesame chutney is made as a side dish to rice. Andhra cuisine is rich in varieties of pickles, chutneys. Pickle is a must in everyday meals. Olden days there was not any mixer grinder, people used to make chutneys using mortar and pestle. We also call it roti pachadi or danchina pachadi. It has its own peculiar flavor of those chutneys made in it.

Even today instant vegetable pickles are made. One such is [vankaya pachadi/ Eggplant chutney](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/baked-eggplant-chutney/). One of my posts on the blog. Like vankaya roti pachadi, nuvvula(sesame) pachadi also made in mortar and pestle. You may also grind it in mixer grinder if not having mortar and pestle. To keep the mortar and pestle chutney texture, grind it coarsely rather than a smooth paste.

      There are an ample number of health benefits of sesame. They are a good source of fibre, lowers cholesterol and triglycerides, source of plant protein and B vitamins. As it is a good source of protein, helps in increasing metabolic rate and curbs hunger. 

Preparing this Nuvvula pachadi hardly takes any time and requires only a few ingredients. This sesame Chutney/ nuvvula pachadi tastes best with hot rice and a dollop of clarified butter(ghee) or as an accompaniment to idli and dosa.

Tempered sesame Chutney

- Adjust consistency as per your choice, usually it is a thick consistency chutney.

**Notes**: 

- You may substitute green chilli with dry red chillies.
- Adjust spice level as per your taste.
- You may also vary it with other ingredients such as raw mango, Peanuts and fresh coconut.
- You may also grind it into a fine paste as per your choice. I personally prefer it coarse chutney which gives a traditional roti pachadi texture.
- It is good at room temperature for a day, you may refrigerate it for additional 2-3 days. These chutneys are usually made fresh and consumed in a day. That's what the roti pachadi concept is all about. Grind fresh and eat fresh.
