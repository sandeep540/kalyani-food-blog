It’s spring time and my garden is full of mint. So I decided to cook something with mint. I had prepared mint rice earlier in an Indian Desi style. This recipe is completely different from that.

Mint plant

The two main ingredients which enhance the flavors in the rice are mint and lemon. Its aroma itself feels so good and fresh this spring time. Spice level is so mild that even my one year old enjoyed this Lemon mint rice.

Cooked rice

- Once the rice is cooked, let the steam be released and then fluff the rice with the help of a fork.

- Don't fluff the rice when it is very hot, rice will turn mushy.
- Add chopped mint, lemon juice and mix well, you can add sliced lemon to garnish the rice. When the chopped mint is added to the warm rice, mint essential oil is released giving it a nice aroma and flavor to the rice.
