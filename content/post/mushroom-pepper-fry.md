Mushrooms are a good source of protein and fibre. Bell pepper in the recipe elevates the taste of the mushroom with freshly crushed peppercorns. It is a protein packed stir fry recipe paired best with any flatbread.

**Notes** :

- Don't cook completely while blanching mushrooms.
- Add green chillies and peppercorns as per your spice level.
- Use freshly crushed peppercorns for best taste rather than a pepper powder.
