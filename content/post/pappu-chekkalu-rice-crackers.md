Pappu chekkalu is a rice cracker prepared from rice flour, soaked chana dal and moong dal, roasted Peanuts and other spices. This traditional snack recipe is of Andhra cuisine. We call it pindi vantalu which is prepared in bulk during festivities where all the family ladies gather around to prepare it.

There are many variations of preparing pappu chekkalu/ rice crackers, nippatlu is different from Pappu chekkalu in terms of taste, thickness and spices. 

Traditionally these are prepared from thadi beeyam which is nothing but soaked rice. So the process goes this way, rice is soaked for an hour or two then the water is drained. Tie the rice in a cotton cloth and  hang it so that the left out water also drained. This is then air dried but not completely dry in sunlight and grounded fine in the flour mill. This soaked rice flour chekkalu gives the authentic flavor to the chekkalu. But due to the soaked rice flour it needs to be used that day itself else it starts stinking. 

My mom used to make Pappu chekkalu with this soaked rice. 

But the other way to prepare this chekkalu is from the dry rice flour available ready in stores. The dough for this chekkalu is prepared in batches to maintain the nice color and crispiness of the chekkalu. My mom's tip is to first mix all the spices and dals and then adding water in batches to maintain the color and crispness. If added more water to the flour the chekkalu will absorb more oil and also difficult to transfer it to the oil for frying.

Frying these chekkalu takes time in medium flame, but I recommend to fry in medium flame because with high flame it will  change color quickly and leave with soft, soggy chekkalu rather than a crispy one. 

These chekkalu are prepared in bulk and stored in an airtight container for a long shelf life.

- At this moment you can taste it and adjust salt.
- Take a small batch of flour and add water as required and knead to smooth and soft dough.

- Keep the rest of the mixed flour aside, and knead into a dough when you are done with frying the first batch.
- This assures you a nice crisp chekkalu. When you mix all the flour together while preparing chekkalu in a huge batch as time passes the chekkalu will turn dark when fried. The leftover flour can be refrigerated and mixed with water the next day in case you couldn't finish it on the same day.
- Grease the butter paper with oil, you can use a plastic sheet or banana leaf also.
- Pinch a small ball sized dough and flatten over greased butter paper with the help of fingers press gently, forming a slightly thin disk.

- Fry until the chekkalu turns crisp on both sides. On medium flame it takes time, but don't compromise to fry in high flame it will be burnt and won't be crisp.

- While frying it in oil don't crowd it with lots of chekkalu.
- Lay over the kitchen paper towel to absorb excess oil.
- You may also use iron poori press for making pappu chekkalu instead of flattening with fingers.
- For beginners if it's difficult for you transferring the flattened chekkalu to oil, you may do the following explained step wise with photos. once the ladle dipped in hot oil, chekkalu releases within a minute.

**Notes**:

- For authentic taste use freshly grind rice flour by soaking in water and air drying it. See introduction..
- Adjust spice level as per your taste.
- If preparing in bulk quantity, mix all the ingredients except water. At this stage you may taste and adjust salt. Take little amount of flour and add water. Once this batch is fried, take more flour to make dough.
- You may refrigerate the flour mixed with ingredients without water and make it next day.
- The color of the fried chekkalu will not be golden brown but pale color.
- Fry in medium heat, it takes time but believe me they turn super crispy.
