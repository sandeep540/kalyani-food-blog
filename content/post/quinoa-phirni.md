Phirni is a sweet pudding made by boiling milk, sugar with either rice, broken wheat, vermicelli etc. Today I thought of trying this Phirni with quinoa.

Quinoa Phirni

Phirni is similar to rice kheer(payasam). Phirni is made from soaked, ground rice whereas rice kheer is made from whole rice. Both are creamy and rich in flavors.

Phirni is traditionally served in small earthen bowls. 

When I tried [Quinoa motichoor lado](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2019/12/26/quinoa-ladoo/)o it came out beautifully. This gave me an inspiration to try more Indian desserts with quinoa. 

This Quinoa Phirni can be made with any left over cooked quinoa. This Phirni is flavored with cardamom, saffron strands and nuts. Served hot or cold. Addition of saffron and rose petals gives a nice aroma to the Phirni.

**Ingredients**:

- ½ cup raw quinoa
- 1000ml (1 litre) milk
- ½ tsp cardamom powder
- Few strands of saffron
- ½ cup tightly packed light brown sugar (you can add more depending on your taste buds)
- 2 tbsp sliced pistachio
- 2 tbsp sliced almonds
- Rose petals to garnish

**Instructions**:

- Wash Quinoa, rinse and cook. See the notes below for how to cook perfect quinoa. ½ cup raw quinoa will give you 2 cups cooked quinoa. You can also use leftover quinoa to make this quinoa Phirni.

Ground quinoa and milk

- Boil this quinoa milk mixture in a thick bottom pan. I used wide pan. Keep stirring on a low flame/heat.

- Once milk starts to boil add saffron strands, sugar and stir.

Added saffron to boiling milk

- Keep on stirring the mixture so that there are no lumps formed. Also, scrape the sides often and add it to the simmering milk.

- The milk starts to thicken, and you'll get a thick creamy pudding consistency. This will take around 20-30 minutes depending on the heat.

- Add cardamom powder at this stage and blanched sliced almonds and pistachios. Boil further for 2-4 minutes. This Phirni will thicken more once it's cooled down.

- Pour this phirni in serving bowls or earthen bowls for that authentic flavor. Sprinkle some sliced almonds and pistachios on the top, cover it with some lid or aluminum foil and refrigerate it once cooled down.

- Once they are set in the refrigerator garnish it with some rose petals and serve chill.

**Notes**:

How to cook perfect quinoa

1\. Pressure cooker method

- I used a pressure cooker method. First wash ½ cup of quinoa and rinse with water and keep it aside. Now transfer to a pressure cooker vessel and measure one cup  of water and add in it and cook it in a medium heat/ flame till you get one whistle. Let the pressure from the cooker be released by itself, it will take time. 
- Once all the steam is released, open the cooker lid and spread it on a plate and let it cool before you saute it on a skillet or pan.

2\. Open pot/ saucepan method

- First wash ½ of quinoa and rinse with water and keep it aside. Now transfer the rinsed quinoa to a saucepan and add one cup of water. Bring the water to a vigorous boil, then lower heat and simmer, covered, until quinoa is tender but still chewy and white spiral-like threads appear around each grain.
