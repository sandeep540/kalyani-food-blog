The idea of making Carrot peels(skin) chutney popped out when I had a lot of carrot peels from my earlier recipe, [baked carrot soup](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/05/01/baked-carrot-soup/). Usually these I use in the making of vegetable stock.

Carrots are full of vitamins, minerals and fibers that are good for health. The carrot peels are perfectly edible, and contain the same nutrients as the whole carrot. The only thing to be taken care of is that it should be washed thoroughly as it contains the soil particles and we don't want to consume that.

Few carrots are more sweet and few just bland. To balance the sweet taste of carrot peels I was wondering what to add to balance it. There to my rescue my homegrown fenugreek leaves. I usually harvest it before it starts its true leaves. This time I had around 4 inches nicely grown fenugreek which I used in the chutney. For one cup tightly packed peels I added ¼ cup tightly packed fenugreek. You may add around ½ cup also.

Home grown fenugreek

That fenugreek perfectly balanced the chutney taste. To furthermore balance the flavors and taste I added tamarind and Jaggery(optional).
