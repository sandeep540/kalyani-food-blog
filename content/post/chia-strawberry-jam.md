We had fresh strawberries at home . Apart from eating those as such I tried my hands on preparing some strawberry Jam. I like fruit jams a lot but due to enormous sugar content in the store bought jam i stopped consuming those.

When I had fresh strawberries at home, I thought of preparing no preservatives, no sugar jam which I can enjoy with a bite of bread or rusk. 

This chia strawberry Jam is a healthy option packed with real fruits and antioxidants. It is made of only three ingredients- strawberries, chia seeds and lemon juice. If you feel the strawberries are sour you may add maple syrup or honey. The other option is once your jam is prepared you may also add stevia. 

I added only a tbsp of maple syrup. This chia strawberry Jam stays good in the refrigerator for a week and upto 3 months when freezed. 

I prefer making a fresh batch. You may use fresh strawberries which are available in the spring season or in winters you may use the frozen strawberries too. This recipe works great with fresh as well as frozen berries. Other chia berries Jam which you may try are blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, etc. From berry to berry taste, consistency change.

Chia seeds are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, rich in antioxidants and they also provide fibre, iron and calcium. Commercial store bought jams have lots of sugar content in it and less of fruit. It got its thickness from the sugar content. The chia seeds will help the jam achieve a gelatinous texture while also adding fibre, protein and healthy Omega-3 fatty acids.

This jam gets thickened as we add chia seeds. So apart from fruit we get the richness of chia seeds also. 

It is a simple and easy recipe to make. Only three ingredients and the most important is sugar free and preservatives free.

You can make a fresh batch of Jam each time. You can play with the flavors and taste of the jam. You may add vanilla extract, orange zest, cinnamon, etc to add an additional essence to the chia berry jam.

- I like to keep a few bites of strawberry without mashing up all the strawberries. This is up to you whether to mash everything or keep a few strawberry chunks.
- Once mashed and they start bubbling add 2 tbsp chia seeds and a tbsp of lemon juice and stir well.

- While the jam is still hot it may seem more fluid and thickens as it cools down. Once it's cooled down add to the airtight container and refrigerate it.
- With this the chia strawberry Jam will attain a perfect texture and consistency.
