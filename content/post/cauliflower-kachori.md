Kachori is a round fluffed deep fried spicy snack, originating from India. It is called by various other names such as kachauri, kachodi and katchuri.

There is plain khasta kachori, moong dal kachori, pyaz ki kachori and aloo kachori. These are the stuffing inside the kachori. 

Gobi ke kachori or the cauliflower kachori is the kachori with cauliflower stuffing. The cauliflower is chopped finely and sautéed along with other spices and herbs. This is then stuffed inside dough and deep fried. 

The kachori dough is kneaded with flour, salt, clarified butter and semolina. Clarified butter gives a nice crisp layers to the kachori.These kachoris are deep fried in low to medium hot oil, if fried in very hot oil the kachori will be soft and not crisp. These Kachori tastes best with mint chutney and sweet chutney.

You can dip kachori in the chutney and enjoy each bite or the other way which I personally like is by poking the centre of the kachori and pouring sweet chutney, mint chutney and curd and topping it with some sev.

- Similarly prepare all the kachori's.

**Frying** :

- Heat oil in a wok/ kadai in a medium flame.
- Fry kachori in medium flame. Put the kachori in oil and wait till it floats. Then immerse inside with the help of a frying ladle. This will help in fluffing of the kachori.

- Turn the other side and fry till it turns a nice golden brown.
- Serve hot with mint and sweet chutney.

**Notes**: 

- While kneading dough don't skip to add the clarified butter which gives a perfect crisp layered kachori.
- Fry kachori in medium hot oil for that crisp kachori.
