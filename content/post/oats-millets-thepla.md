Thepla is a soft Indian flat bread of Gujarati cuisine, India. Theplas are typically made for breakfast and tastes best with a side of pickle and yogurt.

            Theplas are made of wheat flour, chickpea flour, fresh fenugreek leaves/Methi leaves and other spices. 

These Theplas were so soft, thin and tasty that my one year old lil girl also ate them. These are my favorite too and I tried to incorporate oats and millets in this recipe.

             These theplas are filled with antioxidants and fibre content and are light to eat as well as healthy too. We have used ground old fashioned oats, finger millet flour (ragi), wheat flour and chickpea flour along with yogurt and other spices.

If you are buying from the market pluck only the leaves and tender stems for the thepla. I have used homegrown Methi leaves, these are small Methi leaves which are rich in protein content. Addition of yogurt helps in soft theplas, for vegan you may use one ripe mashed Avocado.

**Ingredients**:

- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup chickpea flour
- ¼ cup finger millet flour/ragi atta
- ¼ cup ground old fashioned oats flour
- 1 cup fenugreek leaves (tightly packed) finely chopped
- ¼ cup yogurt
- Salt to taste
- ½ tsp Carom seeds/ajwain
- ½ tsp kashmiri red chilli powder
- ¼ tsp turmeric powder
- ½ tsp cumin powder
- ½ tsp coriander powder
- 2 green chilli finely chopped
- 1 inch ginger finely chopped or (green chilli ginger paste 1tbsp)
- 1 tbsp oil to knead
- Additional oil/ clarified butter to roast thepla

**Instructions**:

- You can see my home grown fenugreek leaves below, which I have used. This yielded me about 1 cup of tightly packed leaves.

- Rinse fenugreek leaves very well in water. They tend to have soil particles, washing several times ensures elimination of dirt and soil. Drain them, chop it finely and keep it aside.

- In a large mixing bowl add 1 cup wheat flour, ¼ cup chickpea flour, ¼ cup finger millet flour and ¼ cup ground old fashioned oats.

- Don't add water while kneading as it has yogurt and also chopped fenugreek leaves releases water.

- Knead the dough well, add water or more yogurt if required while kneading.
- Let the dough sit on the kitchen counter for about 10-15 minutes. Whether it is roti dough or thepla dough I keep it on the kitchen counter to rest so that the roti/thepla made are soft.
- Make medium sized balls from the dough. This dough will yield you around 7-9 theplas.

- Take a medium sized ball and sprinkle some wheat flour on it, with the help of a rolling pin begin to roll the thepla round around 5-7 inches diameter.

- Meanwhile let the skillet/tawa be heated to a medium to high flame. Place this rolled thepla on the hot skillet and flip with the help of spatula when one side is partly cooked.

- Spread oil on both sides of thepla and cook it. You may use clarified butter also.

- I usually add oil while cooking in the skillet and then while storing it in the insulated box I pour a spoonful of clarified butter on the upper side. This way while stacking each theplas are coated with Clarified butter on both sides.

- Serve this thepla with lime or mango pickle and yogurt spiced with salt and cumin powder. If the cumins are dry roasted freshly and then powdered it tastes great.

**Notes**: 

- Use only fenugreek leaves and tender stems.
- For the vegan option you may add one whole ripe Avocado.
- For oats flour grind ¼ cup of old fashioned oats, which will yield you ¼ cup of oats flour.
- Carom seeds help in digestion.
- Cook on medium flame, slow flame will make thepla hard.
