Bharwa bhindi or the stuffed okra is an Indian side dish served along with Flatbread/roti, rice and other Indian gravy or dal.

As the name says it's a stuffed okra filled with spicy masala. There is no prep work for this recipe, the only thing to be done is making the masala, slitting the okra and stir frying on medium  flame.

People use different spices in different proportions. Some people use only a few spices, some use chickpea flour, my mother in law uses roasted bengal gram- chutney dal powder. Since hubby likes Peanuts in every recipe so my stuffing includes Peanuts, dry coconut and other Indian spices.

Adding flaxseed is optional and you may substitute dry mango powder with tamarind.

Everyone at home likes okra including me. So I often try different styles of cooking with okra. Be it just stir fry with spices or with onions or the stuffed okra. But always pair it with dal, chawal and roti. Along with okra there will be either dal or sambar for sure at home.

- Stuff all the okra with a generous amount of masala. Keep them aside.

- Heat the wide pan in a low to medium heat. Add 2 tbsp of oil and add curry leaves. Now place the stuffed okra/bhindi in a single layer in the pan.

- After 2 minutes, open the pan and carefully flip each bhindi. Cover the pan again and flip the bhindi again after 2 minutes.

- Repeat flipping and cooking by covering the lid until it's tender and done. This will take around 12-15 minutes.

**Notes**: 

- Cook the okra in a low to medium flame, if cooking on high flame the okra will get brown quickly but it won’t get cooked.
- Flip the okra carefully after every 2 minutes for even cooking.
- Place the stuffed okra in a single layer in a large pan, which ensures proper, even cooking of the okra.
- Adjust spice level as per your taste.
- Avoid the complete slit of the okra, keep joined at one end.
- For a dry and no gooey/slimy okra always dry them. This makes cutting the okra really easy. I plan it the previous night if cooking early morning and prep in the morning for the afternoon lunch.
