One of my favorites since childhood, my mom makes this amazing pachi pulusu which literal Translation is pachhi (raw) and pulusu (typically tamarind gravy).

Pachi pulusu

It's similar to rasam without rasam spices and unheated. Region to region its preparation varies little. 

In some Regions it's prepared paste like, thanks to my sister who told me about it. My mom's version of pachi pulusu is spicy, more watery and light. 

The secret tip is roasting dry red chilli in direct flame. 

 I still remember the day I prepared it for the first time when dad was craving for it and mom said she'll make it the next day. I stepped into the kitchen to make it and mom guided me step by step because the recipe is simple with some simple ingredients.

Pachi pulusu is served with some hot steam rice and I also enjoy it as a chilled beverage which is spicy, sour and tangy perfect for that summer days. 

**Ingredients** :

**For pulusu :**

1. 20g or 2 tbsp tamarind
2. 4 cups water
3. 2-4 dry red chilli
4. 1 small onion
5. One sprig curry leaves
6. Few sprigs Fresh coriander

2. 1 tsp Cumin seeds

Soaked tamarind in water

- Squeeze tamarind and extract the juice from the pulp, keep aside.
- Take 2-4 dry red chilli as per your spice level and roast it on a direct flame till it is roasted nicely. People residing outside India who don't have access to flame stoves having induction stove can roast in a pan.

- Pachi pulusu is ready to enjoy with hot steamed rice.

**Notes** :

- Use any dry red chilli as per taste and spice level, I used kashmiri dry chilli 
- If not on a direct flame roast on a pan.
- Use Jaggery or sugar whichever you like and you adjust the quantity as per your taste. Pachi pulusu is sweet, sour and tangy in taste.
- You can skip tempering if you don't like it.
