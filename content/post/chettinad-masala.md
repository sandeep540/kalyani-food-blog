This chettinad masala is a ground powder of dry roasted spices which include coriander seeds, cumin, carom, star anise, cardamom, cloves, fennel, mace, peppercorns, poppyseeds and fenugreek. 

This masala can be used in any gravies, meat marinade or as a seasoning for stir fry veggies or even to enhance the flavor of any rice recipes such as tomato rice, mint rice, mushroom rice etc.

Chettinad Masala

- This chettinad masala can be used in any gravies, or stir fry veggies or chicken fry.

Notes:

- Make sure to roast the spices at low to medium heat without burning the spices.
- This chettinad masala stays good for 2-3 months stored in an airtight container in a cool and dry place, but I like to make little quantities and use it within a month.
- This masala is spicy, so when adding to veggies or gravies make sure to add chilli powder accordingly.
- You can adjust the spice level of this masala with dry red chillies and peppercorns quantities.
