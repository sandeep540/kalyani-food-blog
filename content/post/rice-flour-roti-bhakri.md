When you travel to different regions or places, the best thing is you explore different varieties of food, regional recipes and culture. One such recipe is rice flour roti/ bhakri (Flatbread) which I encountered during my stay in Mumbai. It comes under Maharashtrian cuisine. It is a very simple and quick recipe to make.

It tastes best with any gravy/korma/stew or maharashtrian style lahsun ki chutney. Rice bhakri is served hot, tastes best when smeared with Clarified butter ( ghee).

- It will take around 10 minutes to knead a smooth dough.
- Pinch the dough ball and pat on your palm first and try to make a small poori out of it.
- Then place that poori on rolling board and slowly start rolling.Do not apply pressure as it will break.
- Try to seal the edges with hand if there are any breaks.
- Heat pan/tava and roast on it or on direct flame.
