Vankai pachadi or Eggplant chutney is made as a side dish to rice. Andhra cuisine is rich in varieties of pickles, chutneys. Pickle is a must in everyday meals. Olden days there was not any mixer grinder, people used to make chutneys using mortar and pestle. We also call it roti pachadi or danchina pachadi. It has its own peculiar flavor of those chutneys made in it.

You take any vegetables you'll find pickle or chutney made of Dosakai, birakai, vankai, etc. 

I tried one such chutney called vankaya pachadi which is quick to make. For this particular type of pachadi we use big Eggplant. Eggplant is greased/brushed with cooking oil and then burnt in direct flame at all sides. As I have an induction Cooktop, I baked my eggplant in the oven. In direct flame it is turned all over till it is cooked properly and the skin is peeled out. In the oven I modified it by cutting the Eggplant into halves and baking it, with this there is no need to flip the Eggplant every now and then or worrying about its rolling on the baking pan.

**Ingredients**:

- One big Eggplant (6-8inches long/ 1 lb \]
- 4-6 dry red chilli 
- Tamarind ½ tbsp or 5g
- ½ tbsp cumin seeds/jeera 
- ½ tbsp urad dal/split or whole black gram 
- ½ tbsp chana dal/bengal gram
- ⅛ tsp methi dana/fenugreek seeds 
- 1tbsp whole coriander seeds 
- Oil to grease eggplant 
- Salt to taste 

**For tempering** :

- 1 tbsp oil

- ½ tsp Cumin seeds/jeera
- ½ tsp urad dal/split or whole black gram
- ½ tsp chana dal/bengal gramPinch of asafoetida

- Traditionally you may roast the Eggplant on the flame stove with the help of a mesh pan on the flame, turning all sides till it is cooked completely inside and burnt from the outer side. This burnt texture on the outside gives a nice aroma to the chutney.
- Or you can also bake it in the oven. I baked in the oven. Preheat the oven at 450F. Cut the Eggplant into half and keep it on the baking pan. I used a cast iron pan, placed the halved side of the Eggplant on the bottom so that the outer skin is burnt nicely.

- Bake for around 20-30 minutes. Depending on the size of the Eggplant and oven temperature the time varies. Do check after 20 minutes if it is cooked.

- Meanwhile in a hot pan drizzle 1tbsp of oil and add mustard seeds, when mustard starts to crackle add other spices cumin seeds, urad dal, chana dal, Methi dana/fenugreek and Dhania/coriander seeds. Saute dry red chilli. I used Kashmiri dry red chilli, you may use any dry red chilli.

- Saute till all the tempering is turned golden brown and you get a nice aroma of the spices. Let it cool down.
- Once Eggplant is baked let it cool to room temperature then peel the skin carefully and chop it.

Chopped baked Eggplant

- Add roasted spices along with tamarind and salt to a blender and blend it to a fine powder. To this finely powdered spices add the chopped eggplant and give **just two pulses** to mix the chutney properly with the spices.

- **Avoid blending** the Eggplant to a smooth paste, just maintain the coarseness/seeds in the chutney.

- Traditionally the roasted spices and eggplant is grinded in a mortar and pestle which gives an authentic taste to the chutney.
- To this chutney add the tempering. This is completely optional; you can enjoy this chutney without tempering also.

Tempering for chutney

- In a pan add oil once the pan is hot. Add mustard starts, when the mustard seeds start to crackle add cumin seeds, urad dal, chana dal, dry red chilli and curry leaves. Roast it and before turning off the flame add asafoetida/Hing. Add this tempering to the Eggplant chutney.

**Notes**: 

- Use tender big Eggplant for this recipe.
- You may store this for a week by refrigerating it.
- Depending on the size of the Eggplant and oven temperature the time varies. Do check after 20 minutes if it is cooked.
- You can substitute tamarind with lemon juice although I prefer tamarind.
- First grind spices into powder then add chopped Eggplant and avoid grinding Eggplant into a fine paste. Just a quick pulse will do the mixing of the chutney.
