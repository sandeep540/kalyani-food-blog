Favorite snack in my childhood, made by rice and split chickpeas (chana dal) soaked overnight. The mixture is ground, and the paste is fermented for five to six hours or overnight. My mom used to grind it in the night and next morning we had this delicious dhokla. Spiced by adding green chilli, Coriander, ginger and tempering.

It is steam cooked and served with deep fried green chillies and mint chutney. In India, you'll find different varieties of dhokla prepared with different ingredients. It is an easy to cook snacks and very light to eat. I tried to make the dhokla using quinoa flour.
