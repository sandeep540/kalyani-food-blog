Quinoa Pancake with Butter & Maple Syrup

Pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk (or buttermilk) and butter and cooked on a hot surface  by spreading the pancake batter on a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter.

Pancakes are generally served for breakfast and are usually topped with fruits of the season/choice, maple syrup, whipped cream and dry fruits.

My daughters favorite is strawberry pancakes whereas I like pecan pancakes.

Quinoa Preparation on a Cast-Iron Pan

**Notes**:

- To make quinoa flour, dry roast quinoa in a wok till you get the aroma of the quinoa and then transfer it to a plate or bowl and let it sit on the counter to cool down. Then transfer it to a chopper or mixer grinder and pulse it to a fine powder. Sieve it and discard any leftover lumps formed. 
- You can use  buttermilk in place of milk.
- Batter should be of flowing consistency, you can add more milk/buttermilk to get the desired consistency. 
- You can add chocolate chips, pecans and other berries  to the batter. 
- Pancakes tastes great when served warm with butter, maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream.
