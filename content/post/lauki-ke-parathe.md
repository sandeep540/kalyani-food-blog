Parathas or stuffed Flatbread is my favorite. You can make varieties of Parathas. Vegetable stuffed, layered or mixed with the dough. Easy to prepare and delicious to eat.

Parathas are one of the most popular unleavened flat breads in India, made by cooking whole wheat dough on a tava (griddle). Parathas are thicker and more substantial than chapatis/rotis/flatbread and this is either because, in the case of a plain paratha, they have been layered by coating with ghee (clarified butter) or oil and folding repeatedly or food ingredients such as vegetables have been mixed in with the dough, such as potato or cauliflower, cabbage and radish.

Bottle gourd (kaddhu/lauki / dudhi) is a high in water content and rich in vitamin C, K and calcium. As it is rich in fibre, it keeps you full for a long time. Prepared paratha of the bottle gourd by peeling and grating it. Mixed it in the whole wheat along with other spices. This grated vegetable in itself has a lot of water so that the flour can be kneaded without extra water.

Parathas are usually eaten with Side of pickle and cumin flavoured yogurt. I made cranberry yogurt garnished with fresh oregano and it was delicious in itself to eat as such.

**Ingredients** : 

**For Paratha** :

- 2.5 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 tbsp Water (if required to knead dough)
- Salt to taste
- 2 cups bottle gourd - peeled & grated coarse
- 2 inch ginger and 2-4 green chillies paste
- ½ tsp Red chilli powder or cayenne pepper
- ½ tsp Cumin powder
- ¼ tsp amchoor powder ( dry mango powder)
- ½ tsp carom seeds (ajwain)
- 1 tablespoon ghee (clarified Butter) or vegetable/ canola oil (optional) for applying the rolled dough.
- Additional clarified butter or vegetable/canola oil for frying/cooking parathas. My personal preference is clarified butter, it truly enhances the taste and flavor of the paratha.

- Add grated bottle gourd and knead wheat flour without water to a smooth dough, the water in the bottle gourd will be sufficient to knead into the dough. If required add a few tbsp of water.

- The dough should not be very hard or very soft cover and keep aside for 10 to 20 minutes.

- Resting the dough is very important, it allows gluten strands to relax a bit and makes it easier to do the final shaping.
- Before starting to roll out Flatbread knead the dough once again.

**Cooking paratha/ Flatbread**

- Take a small ball sized dough and dust with wheat flour and flatten slightly.

Dust with wheat flour as required and roll to a small round Flatbread.

- Apply clarified butter or cooking oil and fold it into half, again apply clarified butter and fold it into half. This will give you a triangular layered dough.

- Cook the paratha with ghee till browned and uniformly roasted on both sides.

- Make all paratha this way and stack them up in a roti basket or casserole. I usually serve hot or keep in a casserole.
- Serve lauki ka paratha hot with yogurt, pickle or butter.

**Cranberry oregano raita**

- Beat yogurt to get a smooth consistency and add cranberries, fresh oregano teared, Cumin powder and salt.

**Notes**

- Adjust spices as per your spice level.
- Always roast the paratha on medium flame else it may not get cooked from inside.
- If you want to add lots of bottle gourd to the paratha squeeze out excess water before adding to the dough.
- If the dough is very soft add little flour and knead.
