_Spicy tangy fish curry in tamarind gravy_

From my mom’s kitchen, this chepala (fish) pulusu is a must try for every fish lover. I grew up eating this as my mom who belongs to nellore often makes this. It's a regional recipe and I started making it after my marriage and am still preparing it.

This nellore chepala pulusu is tangy, spicy and delicious. I grew up watching it how mom used to make it. Selection of fish is important for that authentic nellore style chepala pulusu.

It's made in a wide vessel, so that all the fish pieces are not crowded or stacked over one another. My mom's secret to the chepala pulusu is cooking in an earthen pot and a secret ingredient added (roasted mustard, Cumin, coriander and fenugreek seeds powder added at the end).

**Instructions** :

- Soak ¼ cup (big lemon size) tamarind in 2 cups of warm water. Let it soak for 20 minutes. Make a pulp by squeezing the tamarind well. Strain the pulp to get rid of the seeds. Set aside.
- Heat oil  in a wide pan or wide earthen pot. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, and curry leaves. Fry until the curry leaves are crisp.
- Add slit green chillies and finely sliced onions or shallots (small onions)as a whole. Fry till they are lightly brown. 
- Add diced tomato and turmeric, red chilli powder and salt to taste. Cook the tomatoes on low heat till it leaves oil on the sides of the pan.
- Add the tamarind pulp and 1cup of water.
- Simmer the gravy for 20 minutes covered on a medium flame stirring in between (if you feel the pulusu is less in quantity, add more tamarind pulp or water). 
- After 20 minutes the oil would start to float on top. That is a sign that the pulusu has been cooked.
- Add in the fish pieces and let it cook for 7-8 minutes on low flame. Once the fish pieces are added do not stir it with a ladle, it will break the fish pieces. 
- Add 1tsp prepared spice powder and few sprigs of fresh coriander leaves to the pan. Simmer for a minute. Gently stir the whole pan or earthen pot and remove from heat and serve hot with rice.

**Notes:**

- It is said that chepala pulusu ( fish gravy) tastes best when you eat after 5-6 hours of preparation. That's why even though made it in the afternoon for Lunch we enjoyed this pulusu in the night with hot steam cooked rice.
- I highly recommend to add raw mango pieces if its a mango season, the raw mango in fish gravy truly enhances its flavor. 
- Few people also add cut Brinjal or drumstick.
- Add ground spice powder as per your taste, if added more it gives bitter taste.
