By consuming this it is believed that it reduces body heat, more fluids are consumed in summer. Buttermilk/ majjiga is prepared from thick yogurt by adding water and churning it clockwise and anticlockwise with majjiga kavvam/buttermilk churner (made of wood and aluminum). From full fat yogurt you also get butter while churning it.

Lassi and buttermilk are the two variations of the yogurt. Lassi is a sweet version whereas buttermilk is spicy. Plain buttermilk is seasoned with ginger, green chillies and fresh mint, coriander and curry leaves for the masala majjiga.

**Ingredients** : 

- 1 Cup thick yogurt

- 2-3 Green Chilli
- 1 inch Ginger

- Adding Black salt is optional, in the northern India region spiced buttermilk also contains black salt and chat masala. If you want, add pinch each of chat masala and black salt. South Andhra style buttermilk, chat masala and black salt is not added.
- Add chopped mint and coriander leaves. I prefer tearing the leaves with my hand rather than chopping with a knife.
- If preferred squeeze lemon juice and mix it well.
