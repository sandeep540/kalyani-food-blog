Any podi used in southern India is a coarse spice powder with a mixture of ground dry spices that typically contains dried chilis, urad dal, chickpeas, salt and the main ingredient, it may be curry leaves, flaxseeds, sesame, etc.

These podi’s are typically used to eat with idli, dosa, Pongal or steam rice paired with Clarified butter (ghee) for a vegan option you may use sesame oil. 

The flaxseeds are enriched with fibre, Omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants. They are said to be used to improve digestive health, lower blood pressure and bad cholesterol.

The flaxseed podi is made by dry roasting it and other spices and lentils and grinding it into a fine powder. I really like the garlic flavor in it. We call it avise ginjalu podi in telugu.

- Tastes best with an addition of a dollop of clarified butter to the flaxseed powder while eating with idli, dosa or rice. You may also use it in stir fry veggies, for vegan option you may use sesame oil.

**Notes** : 

- Dry roast the spices in low to medium flame.
- Adjust spice level as per your taste. I used Kashmiri dry red chilli, you may use whichever is available.
- Store the flaxseed podi in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
- Once powdered fine then only add garlic with peels and pulse it for 2-3 seconds rather than grinding it.
- You can skip the addition of Peanuts if having any nut allergies.
- Let all the spices cool down completely before grinding.
