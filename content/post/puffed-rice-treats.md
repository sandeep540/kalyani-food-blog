Another recipe On the blog which brings out childhood memories. I still crave for those crispy rice treats. Me and my brother used to enjoy it a lot, whether it’s [aam papad/mango pulp bars](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/aam-papad-mango-pulp-bars/) or this murmura ladoo also known by kurmura ladoo, Pelala ladoo, borugu muddha or pori urundai, etc. These puffed rice ladoo are made either from jaggery or sugar. I used jaggery for the recipe. It is a traditional recipe, which is made during festivities. From toddlers to elders everyone loves this.

Preparing these puffed rice ladoos are simple, but maintaining the consistency/thickness of the jaggery syrup while preparing the ladoo is important. It should be of a soft ball consistency. If it becomes any hard consistency syrup, making ladoos will be difficult. If it's thinner, the ladoo will come apart easily with a stringy syrup attached and sticky. And the syrup consistency changes quickly, it’s best to boil it at low temperature to have a check on it.

I have used a minimum quantity of jaggery so that it doesn't taste much sweet and can be enjoyed for that sweet craving.

- Initially the syrup thickens and then starts bubbling. The syrup consistency goes from single string to double string to soft ball stage.

Stages of syrup consistency

- For this ladoo we want the Jaggery syrup consistency to be in a firm ball shape when you put a drop of it in the water. This jaggery ball should be soft, flexible and not hard.

- When the syrup thickens check the consistency by taking a little bit of syrup to the bowl containing water. Gather the syrup to make a firm ball with your fingers. If you are able to form a nice ball, that is the correct stage. Turn off the flame and remove the jaggery syrup from heat.

- Clarified butter gives a nice flavor to the ladoos as well as helps in forming ladoos without sticking to the palms.
- Store these puff rice treats/ murmura ladoo in an airtight container for that fresh and crisp treats.

**Notes** :

- Carefully make ladoos as the mixture will be steaming hot. Once it is shaped it will be soft but hardens in a couple of minutes, which is ready to eat.
- Jaggery syrup consistency is important in preparing these ladoos.
- The various stages of syrup consistency are thin syrup, sticky syrup,half string, one string, two string, three string, gathering consistency, soft ball consistency and hard ball consistency. For this ladoo preparation we want a **soft ball consistency syrup.**
    - If you couldn't make ladoos after making a few ladoos as it becomes thick or dry to loosen a bit, warm the mixture for two to three minutes and proceed further.
- You can also flavor it with dry ginger powder.
