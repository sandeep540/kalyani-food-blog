Pineapple Pulihora

**Notes** :

- Use raw pineapple for the best taste, if the pineapple is ripe pulihora will taste sweet.
- If offering this pulihora as a naivedya avoid using asafoetida in tempering.
- If your pineapple isn't much sour, add lemon juice to adjust the flavor and taste.
- Remove eyes from the pineapple before grating and discard/ avoid grating pineapple core.
- Grate pineapple coarsely, do not use fine grater.
- Squeeze grated pineapple little to remove excess water content but not too much that it became dry.
