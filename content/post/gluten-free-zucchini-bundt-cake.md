This gluten free zucchini Bundt cake is inspired from the Mangalore’s most traditional sweet dish ‘Mandas’. 

Traditionally prepared from cucumber and soaked parboiled rice along with cardamom, coconut and jaggery.

Saw this Mandas post on one of the social pages, thought to give it a try. The recipe credit goes to my neighbour Venisa. She explained how the traditional recipe is made, cooked in the fire from bottom and also burning charcoal is poured on the top lid that covers the pan which makes it cook from bottom and top. However I just baked it in the oven in the Bundt pan, and it can also be made in any cake pan. This can also be steam cooked, by pouring the batter in a pan lined with banana leaf  greased with Clarified butter, however while steam cooking amount of jaggery added is less compared to oven baked.

The texture of the cake is wobbly and dense. The traditional way of preparing this Mandas involves grinding cucumber and soaked rice in a traditional vaan (grinding stone/mortar pestle). This is cooked in a very slow fire.

This recipe doesn't use any eggs, refined sugar, all purpose flour or any use of yeast or baking powder, hence the cake will be dense. The addition of clarified butter makes the recipe moist. For vegan cake you may add coconut oil, but to get that authentic taste I suggest to add clarified butter. 

I just simply baked it, to get that traditional browned surface in the oven you may broil it in the end for a couple of minutes taking care not to burn it.

**one cup measures 240ml**

**Ingredients**:

- Add clarified butter and blend it again.
- Mix fried cashew nuts to the batter and pour this to the greased bundt pan.

- Remove the pan and let it cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Invert the Bundt pan and allow the mandas to cool completely.

**Notes**: 

- For vegan substitute clarified butter with coconut oil.
- Depending on the size and quantity of the pan and oven used the baking time may vary. For half a cup quantity it took 40 minutes in my oven at 350F. For one cup of rice it may take around an hour to an hour fifteen minutes.
- Add fresh grated coconut rather than a dry coconut.
- I used zucchini in this mandas recipe, traditionally cucumbers are used. If using cucumbers, scoop out the seeds before grinding.
