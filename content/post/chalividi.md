Chalividi

These are specially made for an auspicious days or ceremony like wedding, baby showers, etc. My maternal side have this tradition of sending their married daughters with chalividi, each and every time I visit them.

It is a traditional recipe which requires very few ingredients and also easy to prepare. I have grown up eating this and till today this is my favorite. Traditional authentic chalividi is made using Jaggery, you can substitute it with sugar if you don't like Jaggery.  
These are made in huge quantity, shaped in spherical. The below recipe is of 1 cup of rice but believe me in native it is made up of minimum of 8-10 cups of rice.

Wet rice flour

- In a heavy bottom pan dry roast 2 tbsp urad dal and grind it into a fine powder
- Heat 1 tablespoon clarified butter in a heavy bottomed pan, roast cashews, coconut slices, poppy seeds and sesame separately until golden brown. Remove from flame, keep it aside.
- In a heavy bottom pan melt ½ cup powdered jaggery with ¼ cup water. Boil the jaggery syrup until it forms one string consistency.
- Turn off the heat, add rice flour little at a time and mix vigorously. Add remaining clarified butter and give a quick mix.
- Do not add too much rice flour and make it thick. This will thicken up as it cools. So keep the consistency loose. Don't add all the rice flour at once, add little and whisk vigorously. Discard if there is any excess rice flour.
- Add all the roasted cashews, sesame, poppy, coconut slices and cardamom powder into the rice dough and mix well.
- Transfer into a serving bowl and add clarified butter (ghee) and serve or store it in an air tight container and refrigerate.

**Notes**:

You can make it with only rice flour, Jaggery and cardamom or add coconut, cashews and sesame.

I personally like it with ample of roasted dry coconut slices and other dryfruits, where in each bite you get the nutty flavor.

It can be stored for 2-3 weeks when you refrigerate it.
