These sesame oats cookies are healthy and gluten free. So the idea popped up with my previous [wheat millet cookies](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/wheat-millet-cookies/), an Indian flavor cookie. I had plenty of ripened bananas at home so tried these gluten free cookies using bananas. Added very little brown sugar as the bananas are sweet.

These cookies are easy to make and a healthy snack to pack for kids to school or that after school evening snack with a glass of milk. Because of millet flour used, these cookies keep you filling for a long time.

The cookies have a nice nutty flavor of sesame with the addition of tahini to the dough and sesame seeds coated in the top.

**Notes:**

1. Use overripe bananas.

2\. Oat flour can be made by grinding oats into a fine powder at home.
