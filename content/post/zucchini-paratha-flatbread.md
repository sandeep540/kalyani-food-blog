Parathas or stuffed Flatbread is my favorite. You can make varieties of Parathas. Vegetable stuffed, layered or mixed with the dough. Easy to prepare and delicious to eat. 

Parathas are one of the most popular unleavened flat breads in India, made by cooking whole wheat dough on a tava (griddle). Parathas are thicker and more substantial than chapatis/rotis/flatbread and this is either because, in the case of a plain paratha, they have been layered by coating with ghee (clarified butter) or oil and folding repeatedly or food ingredients such as vegetables have been mixed in with the dough, such as potato or cauliflower, cabbage and radish.

When there was ample of zucchini in the refrigerator which I usually make zucchini fritters or zucchini cake, thought of trying zucchini paratha for a change. And believe me it tasted yum. Parathas are usually ate with Side of pickle and cumin flavoured yogurt. I tried zucchini yogurt and it was delicious in itself to eat as such.

Zucchini paratha

## Ingredients 

For paratha :  

1. 3 cups whole wheat flour 
2. 2-4 tbsp Water (if required to knead dough)
3. Salt to taste 
4. One medium size zucchini Grated
5. 2 inch ginger finely chopped
6. 2-4 green chillies finely chopped (optional)
7. ½ tsp Red chilli powder or cayenne pepper
8.  ½ tsp Cumin powder 
9. ¼ tsp amchoor powder ( dry mango powder)
10. 1 tablespoon ghee (clarified Butter) or vegetable/ canola oil (optional) for kneading the dough
11. Additional clarified butter or vegetable/canola oil for frying/cooking parathas. My personal preference is clarified butter, it truly enhances the taste and flavor of the paratha. 

For zucchini Raita/yogurt 

1. 1 cup yogurt 
2. ½ tsp freshly ground Cumin powder
3. ¼ cup grated zucchini 
4. Salt to taste 

## Instructions

Kneading dough for paratha

- In a bowl or vessel take 3 cups whole wheat flour, add salt and 1 tablespoon clarified butter or oil.
- Add finely chopped ginger, green chillies(optional), red chilli powder, Cumin and amchoor powder. 
- Add grated zucchini and knead wheat flour without  water to a smooth dough, the water in the zucchini will be sufficient to knead into a dough. If required add few tbsp of water. 
- The dough should not be very hard or very soft cover and keep aside for 20 to 30 minutes. 
- Resting the dough is very important, it allows gluten strands to relax a bit and makes it easier to do the final shaping.
- Before starting to roll out Flatbread knead the dough once again.

## Cooking zucchini paratha/ Flatbread   

- Take a small ball sized dough and dust with wheat flour and flatten slightly.
- Dust with wheat flour as required and roll to a round Flatbread/paratha 
- on a hot pan (tawa or skillet or griddle) place the rolled zucchini paratha.

- Cook the zucchini paratha with ghee till browned and uniformly roasted on both sides.
- you can also press the zucchini paratha edges with a spatula, so that they are fried well as sometimes the paratha edges are not cooked well. 
- Make  all zucchini paratha this way and stack them up in a roti basket or casserole. I usually serve hot or keep in a casserole.
- Serve zucchini paratha hot with yogurt, pickle or butter.

##  Zucchini Raita

Beat yogurt to get a smooth consistency and add grated zucchini, Cumin powder and salt.   

**Notes**

- Adjust spices as per your spice level.
- Always roast the paratha on medium flame else it may not get cooked from inside.
- If you want to add lots of zucchini to the paratha squeeze out excess water before adding to the dough.
