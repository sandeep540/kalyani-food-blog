Qubani or khubani ka meetha is an Indian sweet made from dried apricots originating from Hyderabad, India.

Khubani or qubani or khobani is an urdu term for apricots. It is a common dessert being served at Hyderabadi weddings. Years ago I tasted this dessert for the first time at my friend's wedding and then after my wedding at my in-laws place had this which was outsourced for the small party.

Apricots

Although I never thought of making it at home as hubby's favorite dessert is double ka meetha or the Shahi Tukda which is again Hyderabad’s iconic dessert. 

A friend of mine who is expecting was craving for Qubani ka meetha, I thought to give it a try. And believe me this came out super yummy. Even hubby liked it a lot, what more can I ask for. It requires only a few ingredients which are available in the pantry apart from our main ingredient Qubani or the apricots.

The dried apricots are washed and then soaked in sufficient water overnight and then cooked in the same water. This tastes great with a whipped cream, malai rabdi, vanilla ice cream or just like that garnished with fried nuts and rose petals.

Apricots have an amazing health benefits and including them in diet helps in increasing dietary fibre, potassium, iron and antioxidants.

- Wash the dried apricots and soak it in 6 cups of water for a minimum of 4-5 hours or overnight. You may also use warm water for quick soaking and preparing the dessert.

- After soaking for 4-5 hours or overnight it will become soft by absorbing the water and double in size.

- Remove it from the water. I used dried deseeded apricots (as that was available to me). If you used a whole dried apricot with seeds inside then remove the seeds and keep aside.

- Take the apricot seeds (kernel) and break it with the help of nutcracker or stone and remove the nuts (it is similar like almond). Use this to garnish the dessert.
- Do not throw the soaked water, keep aside for cooking the soaked apricots.
- Take a thick bottom wok or pan and add soaked water into it . Let the water simmer, add soaked apricots and cook it in medium to high flame. It will take around 15-20 minutes to cook.

- Once it's cooked, mash it a little with the help of a potato masher or hand blender as per your choice. I like to keep a little pulpy rather than a smooth batter consistency so I used a potato masher.

- Now add sugar in it and bring it to the boil till all sugar dissolves and it reaches a thick pulpy mixture, it will take another 15 - 20 minutes then add lemon juice to it.

**Notes**: 

- Adjust sweetness as per your taste.
- You may use crystalline sugar or light brown sugar.
- Adding whipped cream is optional but it tastes great paired with whipped cream or malai rabdi, custard, vanilla ice cream or apricot ice cream, etc.
- If using whipped cream let the khubani ka meetha cool down else the whipped cream will be melted.
- Use the same water for boiling in which it is soaked.
- I used plain whipped cream as I don't like more sweetness in the dessert, you may add 2 tbsp of powdered sugar or condensed milk in the whipped cream to make it more sweet in the dessert.
- You can remove the skin from soaked apricots if you don’t like it.
