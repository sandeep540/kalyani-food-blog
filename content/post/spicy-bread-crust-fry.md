Bread is one of my default grocery list which is always available at home no matter what. Every weekend my grocery shopping includes bread, eggs, milk, veggies and fruits.

Running low on time or any quick fix to the breakfast bread is the one which pops up. When we make cold sandwiches I often trim or cut the edges/crust. I use it to make breadcrumbs of those crust  usually or sometimes just discard it when I have very little. 

So what do you do when you have  a number of those crusts of Bread chopped?

The idea to make the spicy bread crusts masala fry as an evening snack striked with the masala idli fry. Idlis are steam cooked made of rice and Bengal gram, typically served as a breakfast with a side of chutney and sambar. When there were a lot of leftover Idlis, we make masala idli fry as an evening snack and it requires very few ingredients which is available in the kitchen.

The important tip for the bread crusts masala fry is to soak it in water and squeeze the water, this will make it soft.

**Ingredients**: 

- 2 cups of 1 inch sized bread crusts (I used multi grain bread which has all the nuts on it)
- 1 medium sized onion- finely chopped
- 2 tbsp oil
- 2-3 green chillies finely chopped
- ½ tsp mustard
- ½ tsp cumin
- 1tsp black gram
- ½ tsp flaxseed (optional)
- 1tbsp bengal gram
- 1 tbsp broken cashew nuts (optional)
- ½ tsp turmeric
- Salt to taste
- 1 sprig curry leaves
- 2 tbsp coriander leaves chopped
