Nankhatai are traditional Indian shortbread cookies made from all purpose flour, semolina, sugar and clarified butter along with some cardamom essence.

As a healthier option, I tried making nankhatai with whole wheat flour, millet flour and old fashioned oats.

During diwali my mom used to make an amazing soft traditional nankhatai along with other savory and desserts. One such dessert which was everyone's favorite at home was madatha kaja. I tried the same with almonds, [almond madatha kaja](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/01/20/almond-madatha-kaja/).

The word nankhatai is derived from Persian word “Naan” meaning bread and “Khatami” meaning biscuit.

In short these nankhatai are eggless cookies which are delicious, light and crisp. These nankhatai are easy to make and a healthy snack to pack for kids to school or that after school evening snack with a glass of milk.

Traditional nankhatai is made of all purpose flour, but this recipe is made of whole wheat, millet flour and oats. Clarified butter enhances the overall flavor of the nankhatai. Traditional recipes use powdered sugar but I like brown sugar which needs not to be powdered. You can use tightly packed light brown sugar. I used cardamom powder for the essence, you may also use cinnamon, pumpkin spice or vanilla flavors as well.

The dark color of the nankhatai is due to the addition of ragi (finger millet flour). The semolina used in the recipe gives a nice crunch and texture to the nankhatai.

- Add milk so that the mixture should be able to come together and hold itself. The amount of milk added depends on the quality of flour. Always add milk little at a time, mix and then add more as per required.

- Gently bring together the nankhatai dough into a ball, avoid kneading the dough. Gently mixing is sufficient.

- Make small size balls, I used a cookie scoop so that all the nankhatai made are of the same size.

- Place slivered almonds or pistachios on top of each nankhatai and slightly flatten into a cookie.

Flatten nankhatai

- Place these nankhatai on the greased tray maintaining distance between the two nankhatai.
- Bake the nankhatai in a preheated oven at 350F for 20-25 minutes, in my oven it took 22 minutes to bake a perfectly soft nankhatai.
- As every household oven temperature varies, it may take less or more time, so do check after 20 minutes. The longer you keep in the oven it will be hard and burnt at the bottom.
- Once removed from the oven keep it on the baking tray for a couple of minutes then transfer it to a wire rack for cooling. When the nankhatai are cooled at room temperature, store it in an airtight container.

- You get 12-15 medium size nankhatai with this mixture. Double the quantity for more nankhatai.
- Enjoy these nankhatai with evening tea or anytime hunger snacks for kids.

**Notes**: 

- You can also use granulated sugar. I always prefer brown sugar over granulated sugar.
- To maintain an equal size of nankhatai use any spoons or scoops.
- Use semi solid state clarified butter for good results.
- You can skip salt if using salted clarified butter.
- Since every household oven temperature varies, it may take less or more time, so do check after 20 minutes. The longer you keep in the oven it will be crispy and hard and burnt at the bottom.
- I used cardamom powder for the flavor, you may also use cinnamon, pumpkin spice or vanilla flavors as well.
