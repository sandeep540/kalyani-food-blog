Summers are all about preparing foods available in the season like mango or preparing food stuff to beat that scorching heat. One such summer coolant drink is ambali or the ragi ambali. Ragi is a finger millet.

Ragi ambali/millet porridge

You’ll find every household in Andhra region either in India with buttermilk or ambali at home prepared in large quantities. You can find raw mango and ripe mango recipes on the blog, my previous blog posts [mavidikai pulihora](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/03/mango-rice-mavidikai-pulihora/) and [mamidi tandra/aam papad](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/aam-papad-mango-pulp-bars/) do give it a try this summer where mangoes are available in the season.

By consuming ambali, it is believed that it reduces body heat, more fluids are consumed in summer. 

Ambali or the ragi ambali is a flavoured summer drink just like [masala majjiga](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/13/masala-majjiga-spicy-buttermilk/). Ambali is a finger millet drink which has an additional buttermilk to it along with some onions, curry leaves and green chilies.
