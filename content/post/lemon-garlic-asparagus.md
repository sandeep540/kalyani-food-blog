Springtime is all about cooking and baking spring veggies. One such is asparagus. Easy to prepare the recipe and tastes great.

Can be prepped for lunch or dinner as a side while the main course is getting ready. A good finger food for kids too, where my one year old just loved munching it.

This asparagus is low in calories and a great source of nutrients. It is high in antioxidants. Seasoned this asparagus with lemon and garlic along with salt and pepper which gives a refreshing taste to the oven baked asparagus.

- 3-4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tsp Lemon juice
- 4-5 lemon slices

- Trim the woody edges of asparagus. To do this sharply bend the asparagus near the base, it will snap in the right place.

- Taking this as a reference you may trim the remaining with the help of a knife by lining all and chopping it.
- Line the baking tray with parchment paper and drizzle some olive oil.

- Bake until the asparagus is easily pierced through by a fork, which will vary depending on the thickness of the asparagus. Thin asparagus will take less time to bake whereas thick one will take more time to bake.
