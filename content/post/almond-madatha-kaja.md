Tapeswaram kaja or madatha kaja is a traditional layered sweet Andhra cuisine which is crispy outside and soft,juicy inside.

The name Tapeswaram kaja came from the small town Tapeswaram in the East Godavaridistrict of  of Andhra Pradesh where this originated also known as madatha (layers) kaja.

Favorite sweet from my childhood, till today we are very fond of this sweet from kids to elders.

The house is filled with the nice aroma of the sweet, the day it is made. 

It can be made in a regular size or the mini size where not only kids but all the age group just loves it munching on the tiny bites. Today I'll be showing the regular size with stuffed Dry Fruits. 

It is an easy sweet recipe. Few things to take care is that the oil used for deep frying should be in a low to medium heat so that the layers are well cooked and another thing is, once it is fried immerse in the sugar syrup immediately so  that it absorbs the sweetness from the syrup effectively.

I prefer freshly made warm sugar syrup.

Adding clarified butter to flour is an important step as it gives the flaky and crisp texture to the sweet. The sugar syrup made should be of one string consistency and also warm. So the preparation of the khaja of kneading, sugar syrup and frying should be done simultaneously.

Ingredients  

for dough:  

1. 1 cup all purpose flour
2. 2 tbsp clarified butter
3. ¼ cup water or more for kneading
4. Pinch of salt 
5. oil for deep frying

for sugar syrup:

1. 2 cups sugar
2. 1 and ½ cup water
3. ¼ tsp cardamom powder 
4. 1 tsp lemon juice
5. Saffron Strands optional 

For stuffing :

1. ¼ cup Rice flour 
2. 5 tbsp clarified butter 
3. 1tbsp Sugar powder 
4. ¼ cup Coarsely chopped almonds

Instructions:

- Mix the clarified butter, rice flour and sugar powder to form a thick paste and set aside.
- Make sugar syrup for dipping of kaja with sugar and water. Remove from heat just before it achieves a single string consistency and add cardamom powder and lemon juice. Lemon juice prevents from crystallisation of the sugar.

Layer of flat bread with rice mixture and almonds

- Take one rolled Flatbread and spread the rice flour paste on it and sprinkle 1 tbsp of coarse almond powder.
- Repeat the same by stacking the second Flatbread on top of it. This way repeat all four Flatbreads with rice flour mixture and almonds.
- Roll the Flatbread tight to remove any air gaps if present.

Notes :

- Make as many rolls as possible to get many layers. Three flatbreads are a minimum to roll. I used 4 flatbreads.
- Fry kaja on low to medium flame for crunchy and flaky layers.
- kaja need to be dipped completely in sugar syrup for juicy layers for a minimum of 3-5 minutes.
- You can use various dry fruits such as pistachios, cashew nuts, almonds, pecans of a mixture of two to three nuts. 
- Use raw dry fruits. In frying kaja dry fruits will be fried well. Use coarse dry fruits rather than a fine powder for that crunchy nutty taste.
