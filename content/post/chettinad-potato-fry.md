Chettinad masala or the ground spices masala powder is used in the chettinad cuisine. Chettinad cuisine is a spicy and aromatic cuisine in southern India.

This chettinad aloo fry is seasoned with chettinad masala, a ground powder of dry roasted spices which include coriander seeds, Cumin, carom, star anise, cardamom, cloves, fennel, mace, peppercorns, poppy and fenugreek along with other tempering.

Not only for potato, this chettinad masala can be used in any gravies, meat marinade or seasoning stir fry veggies or even to enhance the flavor of any rice recipes such as tomato rice, mint rice, mushroom rice etc.

Here in this recipe I used big potatoes and diced it after steam cooking, this can also be made with baby potatoes.

**Notes** :

- Make sure to roast the spices at low to medium heat without burning the spices.
- This chettinad masala stays good for 2-3 months stored in an airtight container in a cool and dry place, but I like to make little quantities and use it within a month.
- This masala is spicy, so when adding to veggies or gravies make sure to add chilli powder accordingly.
- You can adjust the spice level of this masala with dry red chillies and peppercorns quantities.
- You may use any big potatoes or baby potatoes.
- store the left over chettinad masala in an airtight container for further use.
