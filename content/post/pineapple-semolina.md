Pineapple kesari is a popular sweet dish made in India. I tasted this pineapple kesari bath for the first time in my brother's marriage years ago. These are the best sweet recipes served in Marriages and functions especially in south India. Easy to prepare and the flavors and taste is mouth watering.

 If I recollect, this is the first sweet dish I made after my marriage. It has many memories. 

The texture is similar to kesari bath but the infusion of pineapple makes the taste and flavor totally different. For added taste and flavor I had added fine pineapple puree along with pineapple chunks.

**Notes**: 

- You may use granulated sugar or brown sugar. I have added ½ cup sugar to 1 cup semolina. For more sweat you may add from ¾ cup to 1 cup sugar.
- For best taste select sweet ripe pineapple.
- Minimum ¼ cup clarified butter is required for 1 cup of semolina. You may add from ⅓ to ½ cup clarified butter, depending on one's taste.
- Pineapple quantity may be increased as per one's taste.
- If you like to add more pineapple puree, adjust water accordingly.
- Food color is optional or you may also add saffron strands soaked in warm milk.
- Dessert recipes, I often add a pinch of salt to balance the taste.
