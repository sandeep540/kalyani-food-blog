This dried mango pulp sweet is made across many regions in India known by many regional names mamidi tandra in telugu, aam papad in hindi, samba saadha(odia), aamta (Assamese), amawat( Hindi), managa thera(Malayalam), aamsotto(Bengali), amba vaadi(Marathi),etc

Traditionally aam papad is sweet but one can always vary it with other flavors such as cardamom, chilli powder,  black salt, chat masala etc. 

Traditionally on a large scale this is prepared by mango pulp with sugar and spread in trays and sun-dried.After the first layer dries, another layer is spread over it and allowed to dry. The process is repeated until the desired thickness is reached. The thickness varies depending upon the quality of mango pulp used.

When this thickness is reached the aam papad is cut into pieces and wrapped in greased paper or into different packages.

Aam Papad can be consumed in any season as it can be preserved for a long period of time.

For home cooked aam papad, choice of mangoes are pureed, mixed with sugar, cooked on low flame and then sun-dried. Best part of home made aam papad is you can choose the type of mangoes and also flavor it with chilli powder or black salt. You can also add sugar as per your choice whether it be granulated sugar, brown sugar  or jaggery. This is also a great way to introduce kids to the process of making aam papad. This aam papad can be stored and enjoyed anytime you want. Having a surplus quantity of ripe mangoes, this is the best option to utilize it before it perishes.

I always prefer  brown sugar over granulated sugar, in this recipe I added light brown sugar. You can also use  white granulated sugar or jaggery. 

At home I had left with 3 small mangoes which I used in this recipe. If you have more mangoes add sugar accordingly. 

This is everyone's favorite from kids to elders.

**Ingredients**: 

- 350 g Mangoes (skin peeled and chopped)
- 150 g Light brown sugar

- Once the mango pulp starts boiling, cook for another 5-8 minutes stirring continuously, until the pulp thickens and slightly changes its colour.

- Grease a plate or tray with clarified butter, pour the cooked mango pulp on the plate and spread it out a thin layer.

- Cover the plate with a muslin cloth, so that no dust particles settle on the aam papad. I didn't have muslin cloth at home so I wrapped it with a press n seal food wrap and poked the wrap with a toothpick so that there is ventilation.

- Keep this plate to sundry. Time taken to form the aam papad depends on the sunlight and thickness of the mango pulp poured.
- After complete sundry it will shrink a little from the edges.

- Mine took three days for the aam papad. I poured into a thick layer.

Aam papad

- If you pour the Mango mixture onto a large plate and a thin layer, then take out the whole strip, fold them a couple of times and then cut with a knife.
- Enjoy layered or a thick aam papad.

My other mango recipe is raw mango rice known as [mavidikai Pulihora](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/03/mango-rice-mavidikai-pulihora/).

**Notes**: 

- If preparing in a large quantity add sugar accordingly.
- Different mangoes have different sweetness, adjust addition of sugar as per your taste.
- You can pour the pulp to a thin to thick layer. Thick layer of mango pulp will take more time to dry.
