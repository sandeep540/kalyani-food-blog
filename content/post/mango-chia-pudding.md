Despite their small size, chia seeds are full of important nutrients. They are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, rich in antioxidants, and they provide fiber, iron, and calcium. Apart from the chia pudding you may also make chia energy bites.

With the Mangoes in season all I think is about Mango.
