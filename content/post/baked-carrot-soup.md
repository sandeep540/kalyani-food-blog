Carrot soups are made by pan roast and blending it. This baked Carrot Soup has a fresh flavour, gives a nice aroma of the charred carrots in the oven. This is a vegan soup recipe, used almond paste. For non-vegan you may use fresh cream for that rich, creamy and velvety carrot soup. Added almond butter for that nutty flavor and richness in the soup. You may also use peanut butter.

Tried to incorporate almond peels from blanched almonds, to the soup while blending the carrots which has a good fibre content and nutrients.

Blanched almonds, stock and peels

This carrot soup in itself is so filling that it makes a light dinner along with some bread sticks. Thick and creamy serves the purpose of dip for the bread sticks. 

Colorful on the plate and delicious to slurp that soup. 

Carrots are full of vitamins, minerals and fibers that are good for health.

**Notes**: 

- You may also pan roast carrots, garlic and onions. Baked carrots give a nice charred flavor.
- This is a vegan soup, used almond paste you may use heavy cream if desired. You may substitute almond butter with peanut butter.
- Substitute allspice with clove, nutmeg and cinnamon powder ( grind all in equal quantities, ½ tsp of each ingredient)
- For more spice you may season with an additional red pepper flakes.
- Almond peels are rich in fibre, so instead of trashing it blended along with carrots.
- It has mild burnt garlic flavor, you may substitute it with ginger. Add ginger while blending.
- Garnish with any fresh herb (mint, cilantro, oregano)
