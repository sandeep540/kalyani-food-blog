Ground turkey (Kheema) cutlet

![](images/20191229_135230_original.jpg)

Recipe is inspired with ground (Minced) lamb cutlet, which in my childhood, my mom used to make, and everyone back home enjoyed a lot. It was soft, juicy and flavorful with Indian whole spices.

One fine evening when husband got minced turkey and asked for turkey meatballs, I gave it a thought and instead of preparing deep fried turkey meatballs gravy , I opted for skillet fry turkey cutlets.

Perfect for a wintery evening with friends, served best with mint chutney or mayonnaise and pickled salad. 

The minced meat in itself is a binding agent, you won't even require any flour or mashed potato as a binding agent. I prefer adding whole spices like cinnamon and clove apart from garam masala because it gives you a nice aroma and flavor to the cutlet. I coated the cutlets with breadcrumbs before cooking which gives a nice crunch to the cutlets, crunchy outside and juicy inside.

## **Ingredients**  

1. 1lb lean fresh ground turkey roll
2. Salt to taste
3. 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
4. 1 tsp chilli powder or cayenne pepper
5. 1 tsp coriander powder
6. 1 small cinnamon stick, broken into pieces
7. 4-5 cloves
8. 1 tsp black pepper powder
9. 1 tsp cumin powder
10. ½ tsp garam masala powder (see notes)
11. ¼ cup vegetable or canola oil for cooking
12. 1 small onion, finely chopped
13. 8-10 garlic cloves, finely chopped
14. 2inch ginger, finely chopped
15. 2-4 Green chilies, finely chopped (optional) depending on spice level.
16. Few sprigs of fresh coriander and mint leaves
17. 1 cup plain bread crumbs/ panko bread crumbs

## **Instructions**  

1. In a large mixing bowl add lean fresh ground turkey roll and mash them with the help of a potato masher or wooden ladle.
2. To this add all the dry ingredients salt, turmeric, Chilli powder, coriander powder, Cumin powder, pepper and garam masala powder.
3. Add whole spices cloves and broken cinnamon stick.
4. Add chopped ginger, garlic, green chillies, onion and some fresh coriander and mint leaves.
5. Mix them well together.
6. Make a round shape ball and transfer in a plate.
7. In another plate spread bread crumbs and flatten each meatball and coat both sides of the cutlet with breadcrumbs. Refrigerate coated cutlets for 20 minutes. This will make the cutlets firm.
8. Heat cast iron skillet, add oil. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the cutlets and cook it on a medium flame. Slowly turn the cutlet and cook on the other side.
9. These cutlets are delicate, be careful while handling. Once cooked on both sides transfer to a serving plate/ bowl.
10. Garnish and serve hot.

## **Notes**   

1. For garam masala: In a pan, dry roast 1/2 tsp coriander seeds, 1 cinnamon stick,1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp cumin, 3 Cloves till you get a nice aroma. Pound them together with a mortar and pestle. Transfer this garam masala into an airtight container. Keep leftovers for future use.
2. Mint chutney:

-  1 cup  packed fresh coriander leaves
- 1/2 cup packed fresh mint leaves
- 1/4 chunk chopped white onion
- 1/4cup water 
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 2-4 green chillies 
- 1 teaspoon sugar or jaggery 
- salt to taste    

Blend the above ingredients into a puree, adjust salt and lime as per your taste. If the spice level is high, it can always be adjusted by adding a little yogurt and blending again. Adding lemon juice gives taste as well as maintains color of greens ( mint & coriander)
