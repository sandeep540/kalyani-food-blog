Poha is nothing but rice flakes or beaten rice. Poha Chivda/ Dry Fruit Chivda is an Indian snack made with beaten rice/ poha, nuts and spices. It is a regular tea time snack, available in almost all the grocery stores but I prefer to prepare at home which is healthier and also adjust the spices as per taste.

      During diwali in Maharashtra this poha Chivda savory  is a must along with other sweets. You'll find this Chivda in every household. This Chivda is an easy to make, healthy snack enriched with lots of dry fruits and spices.

There are a variety of poha available on the market, very thin (called disco) poha, thin (Paper poha), medium and thick poha, white poha as well as brown poha from the respective white rice and brown rice. There are two methods of preparation of Chivda, deep fried poha/flattened rice and the other one is pan roasted with little quantity of oil. 

Today I am sharing a pan roasted Chivda recipe. For this method selection of type of poha is important. Use very thin or thin poha/flattened rice or Hajikani poha. I used Hajikani poha. For thick brown poha it needs deep frying.

This Chivda is a perfect light evening snack which is guilt free snack and also a make ahead snack which can be stored in an airtight container maintaining its fresh aroma. Different regions have different variations to prepare this Chivda known by different names such as Chivda, atukulu, avalaki, aval etc 

One best thing about preparing a snack at home is that you can always modify it as per your taste buds. Some like spicy, sweet and salty, less salt or be it for toddler's you can add the spices accordingly.

**Notes**:

- Use green chilli and dry red chilli as per spice level.
- Add dry red chilli powder once the flame is turned off otherwise in hot oil it will be burnt black.
- While adding turmeric to oil during roasting of poha make sure you add the poha quickly to avoid burning of turmeric in oil.
- Add dry fruits whichever is available with you, taking care to avoid adding any nuts if allergic.
- You can substitute vegetable oil with Clarified butter.
- I recommend adding fennel seeds which helps in digestion.
