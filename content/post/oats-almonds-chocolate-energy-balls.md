Oats ladoo

In India we make a variety of dry fruit ladoos (balls). Today I thought of trying oats and almond laddoos (energy ball). These energy balls are delicious, healthy and super quick to make filled with nutrients. 

As it is rich in nutrients it is ideal to serve to kids and elderly people. I often make such energy balls as everyone loves at home. Oats are healthy and gluten free and a great source of fiber and antioxidants. Another main ingredient is almond which is a healthy fat and also nutritious. I used ground whole almonds which gives this recipe a crunch in each bite and also an almond butter. You can use any nut butter of your choice. 

I have used moist and seedless dates which are perfect for this recipe. Avoid using the dry dates as it might be difficult to mix it and combine together. Another secret ingredient of the recipe is melted chocolate chips. You can use semi sweet, dark chocolate, milk chocolate etc 

**Ingredients** :

1. 1 cup old fashioned oats 
2. ½ cup chopped dates 
3. ½ cup almond butter 
4. ½ cup melted chocolate chips/ chunks
5. Whole Almonds 18-20 dry roasted
6. 1 tbsp Chia seeds 
7. 2 tbsp cocoa powder + ¼ cup for coating
8. ½ tsp Salt

- Serve immediately or store ladoo in an airtight container.

**Notes** : 

1. Adjust the proportion and quality of chocolate as per your choice of sweetness. You can use dark chocolate or milk chocolate. 
2.  Adjust the proportion of dry fruits as per your choice. If you are unable to make balls then do not worry, add a little more melted chocolate or coconut oil to the mixture for the binding or add more blended dates. 
3.  Other option to coat the ladoos/balls is with chia seeds, oats flour and almond flour. I coated with cocoa powder.
