Rasam powder is an aromatic and spicy mixture of ground Indian spices which is added to the Indian lentil soup. You can always adjust the spice consistency when you prepare at home rather than a store bought one. I like tangy and spicy rasam, so I add more of peppercorns. When am preparing for kids I make sure to add more of lentils and less peppercorns in the powder.

Rasam, it's also known by other names as chaaru, saaru. It's a South Indian recipe made out of tamarind pulp with the addition of other Indian spices specially black pepper and Cumin. 

Simply it's a South Indian soup which is made in every household of South India. Infants first meal with rice, they just enjoy this.

The base ingredient is a sour and tangy pulp, tamarind for the rasam preparation. 

Every household has its peculiar homemade rasam powder. It passes down to generations, and in the same way this rasam powder recipe I got from my mom. In my newly wedded life my mom used to pack all the sweets, savory, pickles, podi,etc. One of it was rasam powder too. Never felt like asking the recipe as mom used to send it everytime, but now since am staying at miles of distance away preparing my own home made rasam powder at home from my mom's recipe.

**Ingredients** :

- ¼ cup black Peppercorns
- ¼ cup cumin seeds
- ⅓ cup Toor dal (pigeon pea)
- 2 tbsp Coriander seeds
- ⅛ tsp Fenugreek
- 2 tbsp Chana dal (Bengal gram)
- 2-3 Kashmiri dry red chilli

**Instructions**:

-  The way  we sun dry ingredients for chilli powder, in the same  way sun dry all the above ingredients. This is an optional step but this sun drying process helps to store rasam powder for longer period especially if you are preparing in a large quantity.
- Heat a pan (skillet) over low flame. Dry roast all the ingredients separately till  it’s aromatic and transfer to the plate/ bowl.   
- Let all the ingredients cool to room temperature.
-  First, add toor dal and chana dal in a grinder jar and grind until smooth powder. Add remaining roasted ingredients and grind it.
