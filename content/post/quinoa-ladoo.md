Quinoa Ladoo

## Quinoa Ladoo or Laddus

You might be surprised looking at the laddoos whether they are motichoor ladoo or what I am showing it as a quinoa ladoo. Yes they are quinoa ladooâ€¦they look similar to motichoor ladoo but taste different. Preparation is easier than a motichoor ladoo where it requires making besan (bengal gram flour) boondi by deep frying, immersing in sugar syrup which again should be of perfect consistency and temperature.Â So don't worry about all the hard work to be done to enjoy quinoa laddoo and I promise you will love to prepare these ladoos again and again once you try it. My elder daughter who is 4 years old loved these laddoos and every now and then she just comes to me asking, mumma can I have one laddoo please ðŸ˜‹

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Quinoa washed, rinsed and cooked. See the notes below for how to cook perfect quinoa.
- 1/2 cup granulated white sugar, you can also use brown sugar if desired. Here in this recipe I used white granulated cane sugarÂ 
- 4-5 saffron strands
- Pinch of cardamom powder
- 2 Tablespoons Ghee (Clarified Butter)
- 16-20 cashew nuts, broken or choice of your dry fruits
- Pinch of yellow or orangeÂ  food colouring, here I used orange food color.
- A pinch of Cardamom, you can skip it if not very fond of Cardamom. But I use it in every Indian dessert which I make and it truly enhances the flavor and taste of the dessert.

## Preparation

- In a pan, heat 1 tbsp ghee (clarified Butter) and fry the broken cashews or any Dry Fruits of your choice until golden brown
- In the remaining ghee (clarified butter), saute the cooked quinoa for about one to two minutes and add sugar. Stir continuously.Add cardamom powder and, saffron strands and yellow or orangeÂ  food color. Stir well.
- Add remaining 1 tbsp ghee and stir until mixture starts to leave the side of the pan.
- Add the fried cashews or the choice of Dry Fruits you used and stir. Remove from heat.
- Let it sit on the counter for a while till it becomes warm and prepare laddus. Grease your palms with ghee (clarified Butter) to shape the laddoos as round balls. Shape the laddoos as small or big whichever you prefer, I prefer the size which kids can hold it and eat.
- You can also serve it as a warm halwa/sheera/kesari baath.

## Notes

How to cook perfect quinoa 

_**Pressure cooker method**_

I used a pressure cooker method. First wash one cup of quinoa and rinse with water and keep it aside. Now transfer to a pressure cooker vessel and measure two cups of water and add in itÂ  and cook it in a medium heat/ flame till you get one whistle. Let the pressure from the cooker be released by itself, it will take time.Â 

Once all the steam is released open the cooker lid and spread it on a plate and let it cool before you saute it on a skillet or pan.

_**Open pot/ saucepan method**_

First wash one cup of quinoa and rinse with water and keep it aside. Now transfer the rinsed quinoa to a saucepan and add two cups of water. Bring the water to a vigorous boil, then lower heat and simmer, covered, until quinoa is tender but still chewy and white spiral-like threads appear around each grain.

## Storage

These laddoos can stay great up to a day in room temperature. No refrigeration needed. Store in a cool dry place. If you refrigerate, it gets hard and you will need to warm it slightly in a microwaveÂ  before serving to make it soft again.
