Traditionally sabudana vada or the sago fritters are crisp deep fried patties made with tapioca pearls, peanuts, potatoes and Indian herbs. It is a very popular Maharashtrian tea time snack and also consumed as a fasting food. Tastes best with any green chutney or ketchup. My kids usually like this to eat with ketchup. These were one of the foods I enjoyed during my stay in Mumbai, Maharashtra, a mouth watering evening snack especially in monsoon.

Rather than deep frying I made these sago fritters in an appam pan/ aebleskiver pan. 

It's texture is crisp from outside and soft gooey on the inside. To make a crisp sago fritters, sago should be soaked properly without being mushy and also the potato needs to be boiled perfectly taking care not to be mushy or soggy. Soggy potatoes often break up the sago fritters due to excess moisture.

Sago

- Soak sago in water for an hour. Drain the excess water and keep it for about 5-6 hours. This process will give you a nice fluffy sago without being mushy.

- Mix all the ingredients well, if required add a tablespoon of water not more than that. Grease your fingers with oil if the dough turns sticky.

- Scoop a tablespoon size dough, shape it round. Shape all the dough and keep it aside in a plate.

- Meanwhile heat the appam pan/ aebleskiver pan in low to medium heat. Once it is heated add a drop of oil in each cavity of the pan. Let it heat for a few seconds .

- Add shaped sago balls to the pan and cover it with a lid. Let this cook on a low heat.

- This will take around 7-8 minutes. Remove the lid and flip the sago fritters with the help of a spoon or butter knife.

- Cook it on the other side for a few minutes (**without covering the lid** )and remove from the pan.
- Repeat for the remaining sago balls.

**Notes** : 

- Using flour ensures crispy fritters. If fasting use samo flour else you may also use rice flour.

- For a nice fluffy sago, I highly recommend planning it ahead. For the next morning, plan it night or you may begin soaking the sago in the morning for making it in the evening.
- Make sure the potato is perfectly steam cooked and not mushy or soggy, which will add extra water to the sago dough.
- Make ahead roasted Peanuts and grind it coarsely.
- Grind ginger green chillies into a coarse paste.
- If you like, you may also deep fry it in a cooking oil, by flattening those sago balls into patties.
- You can substitute potato with cooked raw plantain (half)
