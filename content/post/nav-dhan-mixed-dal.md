This mixed dal recipe is from my friend from bangalore. They invited us for lunch and there we tasted this delicious dal. It was so delicious that I thought it would be very difficult to prepare. But in fact the recipe and ingredients involved is very simple yet delicious. It's perfectly paired with any flatbread, nan or even steam cook rice. My husband just sat down and enjoyed the dal after he finished his food.

It is a nav dhan ( 9 bean mix) dal. The nine beans are kidney beans, whole moong, kala chana, black beans, red chori, muth, whole urad(black matpe), whole val, whole toor. These nav dhan are easily available in any Indian store or you can add all the dals available at home. You can measure 2 tbsp of each dal.(lentil) or take 1 cup of mixed dal. It is nutritious, rich in fibre and also tastes good.

**Ingredients**:

![](https://cooknbakekalyani.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/img_6132.jpg?w=1024)

- 1 cup mixed dal ( nav dhan) - soak overnight in sufficient water
- 1 Small Onion finely chopped
- 1 tsp ginger garlic paste
- 2-3 green chillies slit
- 2-3 tomatoes finely chopped
- 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp red chilli powder
- Pinch of Asafoetida
- 2 tbsp Clarified butter/ ghee
- Salt to taste

**Instructions**:

- Take 1 cup mixed dal and rinse several times and soak the dal/lentils for overnight (5-6 hours)
- Add the soaked dal in pressure cooker/ slow cooker / instant pot. To this add salt, 1/8 tsp turmeric, asafoetida and water. The water level should be above lentils. Pressure cook it for 4-6 whistles or until it is cooked completely such that you can mash the dal/ lentils.
- Mash the dal once it is cooked and keep it aside.
- In a pan add clarified butter when it is hot. To this add finely chopped onions and sautÃ© till golden brown.
- Add ginger garlic paste and saute for a minute. Add chopped tomatoes, green Chilli, 1/8 tsp turmeric, salt and red chilli powder. Cook well till oil separates out or till the tomatoes are cooked well.
- To this add the mashed dal and 1 cup of water in a medium flame and let it cook for around 15 minutes.
- Adjust the consistency of dal as per your taste. I personally prefer little watery consistency. For that creamy texture of dal cook it on a low flame for a long time.
- Serve it hot with any flatbread/ naan/ roti or rice.

**Notes**:

- You can vary the measure of individual dals or skip any specific dal if allergic or someone from the family don't like eating a particular dal.
- Best tastes when served hot. You can garnish with clarified butter(ghee), finely chopped onions, coriander and lemon juice.
- For that creamy rich consistency cook dal on a slow flame for a long time.
