Steel-cut oats, also called pinhead oats, coarse oatmeal or Irish oatmeal are groats of whole oats which have been chopped into two or three pinhead-sized pieces. Steel cut oats are better than the rolled oats as steel-cut oats are minimally processed, and because they contain more fiber and density than their counterparts. Steel cut oats are one of the healthiest grains you can eat.

  Oats provide nutrients and fiber. How about eating this steel cut oats Flatbread/roti rather than porridge or breakfast cereal. Yes I made oats Flatbread/phulka/roti which was soft, fluffy and thin. 

This is inspired from my previous [rice flour roti/bhakri](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/01/23/rice-flour-roti-bhakri/). Rice flour is also gluten free and I made the flatbread/roti using warm water and adding the flour, kneading and rolling it out. Followed the similar procedure for making steel cut oats Flatbread. To get the oats flour, grind it into a fine flour in a mixer grinder/food processor, sieve it and use the flour.

The reason to use the  steel cut oats rather than the old fashioned oats is its high fibre content and low glycemic index. 

It tastes best with any gravy/korma/stew or maharashtrian style lahsun ki chutney. Oats chapati/Flatbread is served hot, tastes best when smeared with Clarified butter ( ghee).

- Pinch the dough ball and pat on your palm first and try to make a small poori out of it.

- Then place that poori on the rolling board and slowly start rolling.Do not apply pressure as it will break.

- Store the hot Flatbread/roti in a casserole or roti basket. This will retain the steam and keeps it soft and fluffy.

**Notes**:

- Cook the flatbread/roti on medium to high flame.
- Tastes best when served hot.
- Oats flour and water proportion should be 1:1
- Adding salt is optional.
