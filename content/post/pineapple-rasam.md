We call it Rasam, it's also known by other names as chaaru, saaru. It's a South Indian recipe made out of tamarind pulp with the addition of other Indian spices specially black pepper and Cumin. 

Simply it's a South Indian soup which is made in every household of South India. Infants first meal with rice, they just enjoy this.

The base ingredient is a sour and tangy pulp, tamarind for the rasam preparation. Since pineapple is a favorite fruit of husband and my eldest kid, we  buy it regularly and sometimes more than one. One ripe fruit and the other completely raw pineapple. So this raw pineapple on the kitchen counter inspired me to make this tangy pineapple rasam. 

I adapted this pineapple in my regular rasam preparation with the same home made rasam powder just by swapping it with tamarind and adding few chunks of pineapple which gives it a nice fruity taste to the rasam. The pineapple adds a very peculiar taste and flavour.

**Instructions** :

- Soak toor dal for a minimum of 15 minutes and pressure cook it. Mash it nicely and keep it aside. 
- Take 4 pineapple rings separately and grind the pieces to a smooth paste
- If you have whole pineapple, peel the skin, remove eyes and cut the pineapple into ½ inch circles and discard the core piece.
- Take ripe tomatoes and nicely mash it with your hands and keep it aside.  you can even give a pulse in the mixer to make a puree. I prefer mashing by hand rather than a puree.
- In a pan on a medium flame add oil when it is hot. When oil is heated add  crushed garlic and mustard seeds.
- when the mustard seeds starts to sputter, add Cumin, dry red chilli and curry leaves and saute it. 
- To this add chopped pineapple chunks of the left over two pineapple rings and saute well. 
- Once the pineapple chunks are sauteed well add turmeric, asafoetida, mashed toor dal, pineapple puree and mashed tomato.
- Add 2 cups of water, salt, rasam powder and garnished with coriander leaves. Allow the rasam to simmer well and remove from flame. The delicious and spicy pineapple rasam is ready to serve.
- Since kids at home also eat this, I skip adding additional pepper powder. You can add as per spice level apart from rasam powder.

**Notes**:

- Use raw, sour and tangy pineapple as we are completely swapping it with tamarind.
- If your pineapple isn't that sour you can add 1tbsp lime juice. 
- Adjust spices as per spice level.
