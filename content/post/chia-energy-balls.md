Chia energy balls

In India we make a variety of dry fruit ladoos (balls). Today I thought of trying chia seeds laddoos ( energy ball). These energy balls are delicious, healthy and super quick to make filled with nutrients.

As it is rich in nutrients it is ideal to serve to kids and elderly people. I often make such energy balls as everyone loves at home. The main ingredient chia seed is a superfood packed with a powerful nutritional punch with very few calories.They’re loaded with fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids and various micro-nutrients.

I have used moist and seedless dates which are perfect for this recipe. Avoid using the dry dates as it might be difficult to mix it and combine together. It is an instant and healthy laddu (energy balls) prepared with only dry fruits without any sugar or jaggery but you may add the desired amount of sugar or honey  to make it more sweeter as per your taste buds.

## Ingredients 

1. ½ cup Chia seeds 
2. 1 cup chopped pitted dates 
3. ¼ cup dessicated coconut 
4. ⅛ teaspoon cinnamon
5. ¼ cup Pecans 
6. ½ cup Freeze dried strawberry fruit crisps 

## Instructions

1. In a nonstick pan or skillet dry roast ½ cup of chia seed in a medium flame or heat till you get a nice aroma. It will take around 5 minutes.
2. Once the chia seeds are roasted transfer it in a plate and let it cool. 
3. In the same skillet dry roast ¼ cup of pecans and let the roasted pecans also cool down. 
4. In a blender/chopper pulse the roasted chia seeds till  you get a powdery consistency and transfer it to a mixing bowl. 
5. In the same blend roasted pecans and transfer this also to the mixing bowl. 
6. In a blender/chopper  take 1 cup of chopped seedless dates and dry blend around 4-5 rounds. Blend dates coarsely. Transfer to the mixing bowl.
7. Blend the freeze dried strawberry fruit crisps into a fine powder and transfer it into a plate where you can roll the chia balls. 
8. Add ¼ cup of Desiccated coconut and ⅛ teaspoon of cinnamon powder to the mixing bowl. 
9. Mix all the ingredients in the bowl and start making a round shaped ball. As  you shape it, immediately coat it with strawberry crisps powder. 
10. Serve immediately or store ladoo in airtight container.

##  Notes

1. Adjust the proportion of dates as per your choice of sweetness in the Chia balls. 
2. Adjust the proportion of dry fruits as per your choice.
3. If you are unable to make balls then do not worry, add little clarified butter to the mixture for the binding or add more blended dates. 
4. Other option is to coat the balls with Desiccated coconut or chia seeds. I coated with strawberry because it gives you that sweet and sour taste.
