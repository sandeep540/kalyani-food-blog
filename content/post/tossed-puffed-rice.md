Uggani or the puffed rice upma is a popular Andhra breakfast. Usually paired with mirchi bhajji, the combination breakfast is called uggani (puffed rice Upma) and bhajji(mirchi bhajji).

That is a typical combination but tastes good with any other fritters. It is light to eat and can be enjoyed for an evening snack or light dinner. A small tip is that although the puffed rice quantity looks more, once it is soaked and squeezed from the water it reduces. Hence use large quantities.

**Notes**: 

- There are two varieties of puffed rice available, the one which is thick, short and white and the other which is thin, long and creamish. Thin one is suitable for Upma. Also it contains little salt so be cautious while adding salt.

- Puffed rice should not be soaked for a long time, else it will turn mushy. Also it should be squeezed properly to remove the water content in the puffed rice.
- You might add slit green chillies or green chillies ginger paste. I prefer adding green chilli ginger paste as everyone at home tends to separate out the green chillies from the plate while eating.
- Make sure the roasted chana dal is coarsely powdered and not very fine.

- You may add other vegetables like diced carrots and green peas. I usually add potato as my husband likes it.
- Make sure to add lemon juice after turning off the flame to avoid bitter taste of lemon.
