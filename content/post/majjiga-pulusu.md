Majjiga pulusu is also known as majjiga charu. Majjiga means buttermilk in telugu dialect. It is an Andhra cuisine which is commonly prepared in every household. It is a simple thick buttermilk made by adding sautéed onions along with other tempering served as a side dish with rice. Pulusu means any sour soup, here we are not using tamarind but the sour yogurt to make this.

I learned cooking from my mom. All the recipes which I make depicts her signature style of cooking. Be this simple majjiga pulusu/ charu. 

Whenever there is a lot of sour yogurt at home she used to make this amazing majjiga pulusu. And along with this mom also used to make urad dal (split black gram) vada also known as medhu vada. Afternoon we all used to enjoy this majjiga pulusu with rice and in the evening mom used to dip vada in majjiga pulusu. This is called perugu(yogurt) vada also tastes amazing.

These seasoned yogurt are best served during summers in India to beat the heat be it majjiga pulusu, masala majjiga/ spiced buttermilk, ambali (ragi buttermilk), bendakai majjiga charu,etc. This majjiga/buttermilk keeps you hydrated and also good for digestion as it contains cumin seeds and ginger. Indian recipes are so rich in flavors with spices.
