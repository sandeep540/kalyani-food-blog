Daddojanam, perugu annam, thayir Sadam, bagala bath, etc are the other regional south Indian names to the traditional tempered curd rice.

This Daddojanam or perugu annam is a comfort food for toddlers, kids, adults and elderly people. This daddojanam is served as naivedyam/Prasadam in temples and also I offer goddess Durga at home as a Prasadam/naivedyam during navratri celebration. Important thing to be noted is when you offer a naivedyam we don't add asafoetida. Other rice recipes offered as naivedyam/prasadam to the lord are pulihora which you can find it in my blog, I made [pineapple pulihora](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/01/31/pineapple-pulihora/) and [mavidikai](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/03/mango-rice-mavidikai-pulihora/) [pullihora](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/03/mango-rice-mavidikai-pulihora/)[/mango rice](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/04/03/mango-rice-mavidikai-pulihora/).

These are not just recipes but are childhood memories. One reason to visit temple in childhood is for the delicious Prasadam, be it pulihora, Daddojanam or vada.

Tempering

- Add finely chopped ginger, crushed whole black pepper, dry red chilli pieces and curry leaves. Use asafoetida if not offering to lord as a naivedya. Turn off the flame and pour this tempering over the mixed curd rice.

**Notes**: 

- Cook rice in medium flame so that the rice grains are cooked soft.
- Mash rice when it's hot and add milk and yogurt little at a time when it is hot.
- Initially it will be very thin but as time passes it will thicken.
- If offering to lord as a naivedyam don't add asafoetida.
- You can use vegetable oil instead of clarified butter.
