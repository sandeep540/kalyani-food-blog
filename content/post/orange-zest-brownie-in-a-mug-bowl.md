Orange zest brownie in a bowl

This recipe serves a single serving being made in a mug or you can also make it in a small ramekin/ ceramic bowls. 

Sometimes I crave for brownie and ice cream, reminds me of Bangalore(India) days where we used to hop to the nearby cornerstone for that death by chocolate ice cream.

I prefer adding oil rather than butter which gives a little moist texture to the brownie. Also I flavored it with fresh orange zest, as I personally like chocolate and orange combinations. 

The important thing is getting the cooking time right for your microwave. Every microwave oven model is different. So you may need to adjust the time to get the brownie to cook properly with your microwave.

If you are making it in a mug with the entire ingredients it will take upto 70-80 seconds on Hi or if you are dividing the batter into two ramekins or bowls like I did it will take 50-60 seconds.

**Ingredients**:

- 1/4 cup all purpose flour (30 g)
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar (50 g)
- 2 tbsp 100% unsweetened cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tsp orange zest
- 1/4 cup water (60 ml)
- 2 tbsp canola oil or vegetable oil (30 ml)
- 1/8 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 small scoop of ice cream (optional)
- 1 tbsp mini chocolate morsel to decorate/garnish (optional)

**Instructions** :

- Add the dry ingredients flour, sugar, cocoa powder and salt in a microwave safe ceramic mug.

Dry ingredients

- Stir with a fork or spoon to mix well and break up any clumps. Especially with brown sugar there will be few lumps.

- Add the wet ingredients oil, water, vanilla extract and orange zest to the cup and stir until the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps.

- Place in the microwave and heat on high until the mixture is cooked through, about 1 minute and 30 seconds for a 1000 watt microwave, or 1 minute 10 seconds on a 1650 watt microwave.

Divided batter into two small ceramic bowls

- If using small ceramic bowls and dividing the batter into two like I did, microwave at high for about 50-60 seconds.
- You may have to experiment and adjust the time for less or more powerful microwaves. If you don't know the power level on your microwave, start with 60 seconds and increase until the brownie is done. It should still be moist when cooked through, not dry.
- Serve this warm brownie with some mini chocolate morsels and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

- If you are a huge fan of death by chocolate ice cream like me, serve this warm brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream pouring on top with some hot melted chocolate and a few roasted nuts.

**Notes** : 

- Try using wide mouth mugs which give greater surface area for that even cooking. Avoid using lean mugs for a mug cake/ brownie. Because in the lean mug cakes the microwave oven heat is not able to penetrate deep inside making it undercook.
- Ideally, filling only half a cup or just slightly more is the perfect amount of batter. The same way as we fill it for a cupcake batter in a muffin tray.
- Use natural unsweetened cocoa powder, I used 100% Ghirardelli natural unsweetened cocoa powder.
- You can swap brown sugar with granulated sugar.
- Pinch of instant coffee powder will enhance the taste of brownie.
- Every microwave oven model is different. So you may need to adjust the time to get the brownie to cook properly with your microwave.
