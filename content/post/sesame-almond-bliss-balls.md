A healthy treat for every age group. My first protein balls made this new year for a healthy start. These deliciously rich sesame almond bliss balls would make a great snack for that evening hunger bite or a light post meal dessert.

If I recollect all my desserts which I made prior, majority are the energy balls or the protein rich balls which we call it a ladoo in India. I’m constantly trying to find new ways to include protein rich snacks in kids diet. 

We make sesame ladoo, almond ladoo and various other ladoos. So I combined together the above two with a few other basic ingredients to create this super easy and quick no-bake snack. It is Vegan,Dairy-free and Gluten-free recipe with high in fibre and healthy fats.  

I like to have a snack in the evening with my green tea and these protein balls are really a bliss keeping me away from that pack of junk.
