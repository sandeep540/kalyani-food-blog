Pulihora is a popular dish from Andhra cuisine prepared from lemon juice/ tamarind, rice and tempering spices. It is liked by everyone known by many names in different regions. It’s known as pulihora, puliogare, puliyodharai,etc in other regions.

            The base ingredient for any pulihora is a sour juice or pulp tempered with other Indian spices and nuts. It is commonly prepared in all the households during festivals and also offered as a naivedya (offering to God in temples/home)

My previous blog post about pulihora variation was the [pineapple pulihora](https://cooknbakekalyani.wordpress.com/2020/01/31/pineapple-pulihora/). The other pulihora which I often make in the summer season is mango rice /mavidikai pulihora. Every year during ugadi (Telugu new year) along with ugadi pachadi I also make mango rice/ mavidikai pulihora. It's been seven years I have been preparing this pulihora every year on the day of ugadi. It became a part of my tradition now.

**Ingredients** :

- 1 cup raw rice
- 2 cups grated raw sour mango
- Salt to taste
- 3 tbsp cooking oil
- Lemon juice (optional)

**For tempering**: 

- 1 tbsp chana dal ( split chickpea)
- 4 tbsp raw peanuts
- 1 tsp Cumin seeds
- 1 tsp mustard seeds
- 1 tbsp Whole black gram/ urad dal ( can use split back gram)
- 2 tbsp cashew nuts (optional)
- ¼ tsp asafoetida
- 2-4 dry red chilli
- 2-4 slit green Chilli
- 2 sprigs curry leaves
- ¼ tsp turmeric

**Instructions**:

- Wash and rinse one cup of rice and cook it. You may use a pressure cooker or an open pot method. For the pressure cooker method add 2 cups of water for one cup of rice and cook it in a medium heat/ flame till you get 2-3 whistles. Let the pressure from the cooker be released by itself, it will take time. Let the rice cool down completely.

- Add cooked rice to the mixing bowl, sauteed mango and tempering. Mix well and add salt as per taste. If the mango isn’t much sour add lemon juice to get the desired taste. Some mangoes are very sour, if so adjust rice and sautéed mango accordingly.

**Notes** :

- Use raw sour mango for the best taste, if the mango is slightly ripe pulihora will taste sweet.
- If offering this pulihora as a naivedya avoid using asafoetida.
- If your mango isn’t much sour, add lemon juice to adjust the flavor and taste.
- Grate mango coarsely, do not use fine grater. Coarse shredded mango will give you fluffy pulihora.
- Let the rice be cooled down and fluffed completely before mixing tempering and sautéed mango else with hot steamy rice it will become mushy.
